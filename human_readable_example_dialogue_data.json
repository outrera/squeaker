This copy is to allow one to look at how the JSON file is structered 
    in order to get an understanding of how it outputs.

This isn't technically a usable data file, but can be easily converted.

You see, this file would actually have percentage encoding wrapped around it,
    making it much less readable or managable by hand.

If you wish to use the JSON files output by this program
    then you will need to decode the strings!

Godot has this function; it is String.percent_decode().

See the dialogue editor source for more information if needed.

----------

A map of the structure of a file is like thus:

Character
    Time/Place
        Data Type Slot
            Data

Each of these is a dictionary.

For every character and time/place, more branches are formed.
    For every branch, 6 data types with their own dictionaries:
    0: Message, 1: Portrait choice, 2-5: Answer1-Answer4
