# Squeaker
Squeaker is an open-source Dialogue Editor made in Godot script for use in low-resolution games.
It does not require Godot to operate (only the barebone features currently) as it outputs a JSON file that can be interpreted by your own game. 

It does require Godot if you wish to use the portrait feature as it does not support external pictures yet. 
This is already being worked on as I plan to simultaneously add a basic animation editor.

Question mode does not save or load answers properly yet. This is the top priority to fix.

3/29:
Now that Godot 2.0 is out I will be resuming development of this tool. As it stands, it's not completely usable. In fact, 2.0 introduced a couple new issues that need to be addressed. Sit tight and this should be much more usable soon.
